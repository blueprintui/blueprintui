# Web Component Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a web component library documentation site built with 11ty (Eleventy). The site uses 11ty.js files that render content via markdown syntax to create comprehensive documentation for web components.

## 11ty files

Follow other existing component documentation `*.11ty.js` file formats.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- Use clear, concise language
- Write in present tense
- Use active voice when possible
- Be helpful and instructional, not prescriptive
- Assume developers have basic web development knowledge

### Technical Writing Best Practices
- Start with the most common use case
- Progress from simple to complex examples
- Explain the "why" behind design decisions
- Include troubleshooting sections for complex components
- Cross-reference related components and patterns

### Code Quality in Examples
- Use semantic HTML
- Follow accessibility best practices

### Cross-References
- Link to related components
- Reference design system principles
- Connect to accessibility guidelines
- Point to relevant external resources
