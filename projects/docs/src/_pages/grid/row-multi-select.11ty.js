The Datagrid Row Multi-Select feature allows users to select multiple rows in a Datagrid at once.
This feature is especially useful when users want to perform bulk actions on a set of rows.
To use this feature, a checkbox is added to each row in the Datagrid.

${getExample(data.schema, 'multi-select')}

${getImport(['@blueprintui/grid/include/core.js', '@blueprintui/components/include/checkbox.js'])}

## Accessibility
- Ensure that the checkboxes have descriptive \`aria-labels\` that explain what they are for.
- Allow users to select rows using the keyboard, not just the mouse.
