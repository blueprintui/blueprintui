The expand button is a form control type which means it can be part of [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) in \`form\` elements.
By default the control is stateless however, if the control has a \`name\` attribute, it will be included in the form data as a stateful boolean control indicating whether the button is expanded or not.

## Accessibility
- Use a clear, descriptive supporting text or aria-label that communicates its purpose.
- Use appropriate color contrast to make sure the text is easily readable for users with visual impairments.
- Use aria-controls to indicate the state of the expand button (open or closed) and the content it controls.
- Provide a way for keyboard users to interact with the expand button, such as by using the enter or space key.
