The selected attribute is used to indicate the current selected item within a group of items.
It assists screen readers by conveying which item is currently selected, [enhancing accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-selected).

${getExample(data.schema, 'disabled')}

The disabled attribute should be used for UI elements that are currently disabled, making them uninteractive.
This attribute informs [assistive technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-disabled) like screen readers that the element, while present in the document
structure, is not usable or cannot be interacted with in its current state.

${getImport(data.schema)}

## Accessibility
- Use clear, descriptive labels for each button that communicates its purpose.
- Use aria-label or aria-labelledby to label the group if the relationship between the buttons is not immediately clear.
- Provide a way for keyboard users to navigate through the buttons, such as by using the tab key.
