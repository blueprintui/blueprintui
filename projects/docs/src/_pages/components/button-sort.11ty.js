${getExample(data.schema, 'disabled')}

The \`disabled\` attribute should be used for UI elements that are currently disabled, making them uninteractive.
This attribute informs [assistive technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-disabled) like screen readers that the element, while present in the document
structure, is not usable or cannot be interacted with in its current state.

${getExample(data.schema, 'form')}

The sort button is a form control type which means it can be part of [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) in \`form\` elements.
By default the control is stateless however, if the control has a \`name\` attribute, it will be included in the form data as a stateful control indicating the current sort state.

## Accessibility
- Use clear, descriptive labels for the button that communicates its purpose.
- Use aria-label or aria-labelledby to provide a text description of the icon for screen readers.
- Provide a way for keyboard users to interact with the button, such as by using the tab key.
- Provide clear feedback on the sorted criteria and order, such as through the use of an icon or label.
